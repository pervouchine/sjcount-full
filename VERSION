Version 0.11	Sep 27, 2013
		1. The output format has changed compared to previous versions. Previously the output format was chr, 
		beg, end, count+, count-. Now the format is chr, beg, end, strand, offset, count. Also, the offset
		has been added compared to previous versions and to bam2ssj. 

		2. A perl script sam2sj.pl is added to the package. 
		This script is line-based and has the same thresholds as sjcount.
		sjcount was validated in all regimes as:
		samtools view ${TESTFILE} | perl sam2sj.pl ${PARAM} | awk '{count[$$0]++}END{for(j in count) print j,"\t",count[j]}' | sort -k1,1 -k2,2n -k3,3n > test.tab
		The output is identical to that of sjcount

Version 0.12	Oct 2, 2013
		1. -unstranded option has been added (basically reduces the number of output lines by 2)

Version 0.13	Oct 30,2013
		1. The definition of the offset changed to: offset = distance (in the query) from the beginning of the read to the SJ
		2. The default for read1 is back to 1

Version 1.0     Jan 28,2014
		1. maxintron, mininteron, margin - deprecated
		2. binsize = 1; deprecated
		3. sjcount: in bondary counts only 'M' in cigar are considered
		4. sjcount2 is a version which tolerates everything (not only Ms) in the cigar for ssc

Version 2.0	Apr 1, 2014
		1. The computation of reads overlapping exon boundaries now includes all, not only continuous reads
		2. maxlen upper limit on intron length: deprecated
		3. minlen lower limit on intron length: deprecated
		4. margin, minimum number of flanking nucleotides to support SJ or EB: deprecated
		5. binsize, the size of bins for offsets: deprecated
		6. maxnh the max value of the NH tag (set to 1 for uniquely mapped reads): added
		7. counting lim_reads now moven to the beginning of the loop 

Version 3.0	May 28, 2014
		1. Simplier ordering function in lists for sjcount
		2. MAIN: sjcount now counts also mulisplit reads
		3. The output format has changed for ssj (chr, str, nsplit, positions, offset, count)
		4. aux test files for perl are sam2sj3 and sam2sb3
