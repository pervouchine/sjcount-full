Version 1.1	The output format has changed compared to previous versions. Previously the output format was chr, 
		beg, end, count+, count-. Now the format is chr, beg, end, strand, offset, count. Also, the offset
		has been added compared to previous versions and to bam2ssj. 

Sep 27, 2013	1) A perl script sam2sj.pl is added to the package. 
		This script is line-based and has the same thresholds as sjcount.
		sjcount was validated in all regimes as:
		samtools view ${TESTFILE} | perl sam2sj.pl ${PARAM} | awk '{count[$$0]++}END{for(j in count) print j,"\t",count[j]}' | sort -k1,1 -k2,2n -k3,3n > test.tab
		The output is identical to that of sjcount
