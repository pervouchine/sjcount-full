Version 1.11	Sep 27, 2013
		1. The output format has changed compared to previous versions. Previously the output format was chr, 
		beg, end, count+, count-. Now the format is chr, beg, end, strand, offset, count. Also, the offset
		has been added compared to previous versions and to bam2ssj. 

		2. A perl script sam2sj.pl is added to the package. 
		This script is line-based and has the same thresholds as sjcount.
		sjcount was validated in all regimes as:
		samtools view ${TESTFILE} | perl sam2sj.pl ${PARAM} | awk '{count[$$0]++}END{for(j in count) print j,"\t",count[j]}' | sort -k1,1 -k2,2n -k3,3n > test.tab
		The output is identical to that of sjcount

Version 1.12	Oct 2, 2013
		1. -unstranded option has been added (basically reduces the number of output lines by 2)

Version 1.13	Oct 30,2013
		1. The definition of the offset changed to: offset = distance (in the query) from the beginning of the read to the SJ
		2. The default for read1 is back to 1
